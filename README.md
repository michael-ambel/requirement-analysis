0. Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository explores **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It covers key concepts, activities, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria to ensure a comprehensive understanding of this crucial phase in software development.

1. What is Requirement Analysis?
   
Requirement Analysis is a foundational step in the SDLC where project teams gather, analyze, and define the requirements for a software product. It ensures a shared understanding among stakeholders about what the system should do and how it should perform.

---

2. Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
   
1. **Clarity and Understanding**: Reduces ambiguity by defining expectations.
2. **Scope Definition**: Prevents scope creep by clearly defining project boundaries.
3. **Basis for Design and Development**: Provides a solid foundation for subsequent SDLC phases.
4. **Cost and Time Estimation**: Enables accurate estimation of resources and timelines.
5. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures the product meets requirements, improving customer satisfaction.

3. Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### 1. Requirement Gathering üóÇÔ∏è
- **Interviews**: Engage stakeholders to gather detailed needs.
- **Surveys/Questionnaires**: Collect data from a larger audience.
- **Workshops**: Facilitate discussions with stakeholders.
- **Observation**: Study end-users in their environment.
- **Document Analysis**: Review existing systems and documentation.

### 2. Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è
- **Brainstorming**: Generate ideas collaboratively.
- **Focus Groups**: Conduct discussions with selected stakeholders.
- **Prototyping**: Use prototypes to refine requirements.

### 3. Requirement Documentation üìö
- **Specification Documents**: List all functional and non-functional requirements.
- **User Stories**: Describe system functionalities from the user‚Äôs perspective.
- **Use Cases**: Illustrate interactions between users and the system.

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä
- **Requirement Prioritization**: Rank requirements based on importance.
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Assess technical and financial feasibility.
- **Modeling**: Visualize requirements using diagrams like ERDs and DFDs.

### 5. Requirement Validation ‚úÖ
- **Review and Approval**: Ensure requirements are complete and accurate.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define conditions for requirement fulfillment.
- **Traceability**: Use matrices to track requirements through the SDLC.

4. Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Definition**: Describe what the system should do.
- **Examples** (Booking Management System):
  - Search properties by location, price, and availability.
  - User registration and authentication.
  - Booking system with details and management features.

### Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è
- **Definition**: Describe how the system should perform.
- **Examples** (Booking Management System):
  - **Performance**: Load pages within 2 seconds for up to 1,000 users.
  - **Security**: Data encryption and protection from vulnerabilities.
  - **Scalability**: Handle increased traffic with horizontal scaling.
  - **Usability**: Ensure an intuitive user interface.
  - **Reliability**: Maintain 99.9% uptime with quick recovery.

5. Use Case Diagrams 
Use Case Diagrams visually represent system interactions, showing how users (actors) achieve goals (use cases).

**Benefits**:
- Simplifies understanding of system functionalities.
- Facilitates communication among stakeholders.
- Helps organize and validate requirements.

6. Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ
Acceptance criteria are the conditions under which stakeholders consider a feature complete and acceptable.

### Example (Checkout Feature in Booking Management System):
- Users can select dates and confirm bookings.
- Users receive confirmation emails within 2 minutes.
- Payment processing is secure and error-free.

**Benefits**:
- Provides clarity on feature expectations.
- Serves as a basis for testing and validation.
- Maintains high-quality standards and user satisfaction.
